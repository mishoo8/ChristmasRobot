# ChristmasRobot
My sister and I have built and programmed a robot to put a Christmas ornament onto the Christmas tree. We chose to build the Robotic Arm Tank from the Makeblock Ultimate 2.0 kit and then we programmed it to do some actions so the robot can finish decorating the Christmas tree. Hope you enjoy our project!
