# MakeblockChristmasRobot
This program controls the Makeblock Ultimate 2.0 Robotic Arm Tank to navigate a terrain and do a specific action (go and pick up a Christmas ornament, go to the tree and put it on tree, go back to initial spot). Once the robot was built, the program was tested on Scratch and subsequently translated into Arduino. In this ChristmasRobot recording, you can see the robot in action, executing the program below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDlzgRngG-M.

## Robotic Arm Tank Description:
The Robot Arm Tank consists of a highly-adaptable track chassis and a flexible robotic arm. This robot is designed to help user grip, lift, and deliver objects in various terrains.

## The Board - MegaPi
MegaPi is based on Arduino MEGA 2560 and supports programming with Arduino IDE. It can be divided into 6 function areas, allowing users to connect with various plug-in modules to drive motors and sensors and to realize wireless communication.
